# Introduction

- Throughout history, humans have continued to divide themselves, oppress, and exploit others. In the process, although both genders have experienced relatively equal oppression, women have had a greater plight in the suffering.
- Life was not the same centuries ago; child marriage and polygamy prevailed India. Irrational practices such as the sacrificing of widows, often forceful, on the funeral pyre of their husbands, that is "sati", were also enforced. In the literal sense, "sati" means a virtuous woman; at the time it was considered that women had to show their devotion to their husbands and practise the act. Moreover, women also had restricted rights to property and virtually no access to education. There was a superstitious belief that if a woman was educated, she would become a widow.
- On top of differences drawn between men and women, there were also divisions on the basis of caste. People were ranked in a hierarchy and as we go down the ladder, the lowest were tasked with keeping the cities clean and work that was considered as "polluting" by the upper castes. The lower castes were treated extremely unfairly by the upper castes - deeming them untouchable, cutting access to places of worship and other basic necessities. They were seen inferior.
- Over the course of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, these norms and perceptions began to slowly change.

# Working Towards Change

- At the start of the nineteenth century, we observe multiple debates and discussions taking place questioning social practices and customs. This was aided by the advent of new forms of communication. These were usually carried out by men, but gradually, women began participating as well.
- As education spread and people could read and write, people could express their ideas and criticisms with the public - more accessible than ever before.
- These debates were often carried out by Indian reformers and reform groups.
- One such reformer was Raja Rammohun Roy (1772-1833). He found a reform association known as *Brahmo Sabha*, later know was the *Brahmo Samaj*, in Calcutta He was keen to spread the knowledge of Western Education in the country and bring about greater freedom and equality for women. He wrote plentifully on the plight of women.

## Changing the lives of widows

- Like most other critics of his time, he argued against certain social practices by showing that they were in no way sanctioned by ancient texts, that the people claimed to follow so religiously.
- The British were eager to adopt his ideas also because of him being recognised as a learned scholar amongst the British and that the British also criticised many traditional Indian practices.

> In this festival, devotees had hooks pierced through their skin and swung on a wheel as a part of the ritual. This was one of the rituals that came under attack when European officials began criticising Indian customs.

- Another famous reformer of the time, **Ishwarchandra Vidyasagar**, used ancient texts to suggest that widows could remarry. His suggestion was welcomed by the British and a new law was passed in 1856 permitting widow remarriage. Those against widow remarriage opposed and boycotted Vidyasagar.
- Young intellectuals and reformers in Bombay worked together for the same cause; in the north, **Swami Dayanand Saraswati**, also supported widow remarriage.
- However, the number of actual remarriages stayed low and were not easily accepted in society as conservative groups kept their stance.

## Girls begin going to school

- At this point, reformers began to realise the important of women's education to improve their condition.
- Vidyasagar in Calcutta and various other reformers in Bombay set up schools for girls. Nevertheless, fear lingered amongst people towards schools for a plethora of narrow-minded reasons.
- Therefore, throughout the nineteenth century, most educated women were taught at home by liberal fathers or husbands, or occasionally taught themselves. As we read in Class VII about **Rashsundari Debi**, she was one of the women who educated herself, in secrecy and flickering candles at night.
- In aristocratic Muslim households in North India, women learnt to read the Koran in Arabic. They were taught by woman who came to teach.
- The first Urdu novels began to be written from the late nineteenth century. These were directed to "encourage women to read about religion and domestic management in a language they could understand".

## Women write about women

- From the early twentieth century, Muslim women like the Begums of Bhopal played a notable role in promoting education among women; they found the primary school for women.
- **Pandita Ramabai**, a great scholar of Sanskrit wrote a book about the miserable lives of upper-caste Hindi women. She also founded a widows' home at Poona, where women were trained to support themselves economically.
- However, some Hindi nationalists felt that this would destroy their Hindu culture and orthodox Muslims were also worried.
- From the 1920s, women began participating in many nationalist and socialist movements.

> [!note] Law against child marriage
> In 1929, the Child Marraige Restraint Act was passed. The act stated that no man before the age of 18 and no woman before the age of 16 could marry. Subsequently, these bounds were increased to 21 for men and 18 for women.

# Caste and Social Reform

- A majority of the members of these associations were upper caste people.
- Over the course of the nineteenth century, Christian missionaries set up schools for tribal groups and the so-called lower caste children. These allowed them to gain skills in order to cope up with the quickly evolving world around them.
- At the same time, the poor fled the villages for jobs in cities, creating a huge demand for labour. Some also left to work in plantations in Assam, Mauritius, Trinidad, and Indonesia.

> [!tip] Since most work that the upper-castes considered "polluting" was handed over to the "lower"/"untouchable" castes, when there was an increasing demand for certain goods in the First World War, they found an opportunity to gain profit by lifting the prices.

## Demands for equality and justice

- By the second half of the nineteenth century, people from within the Non-Brahman castes began organising movements against caste discrimination, and demanded social equality and justice.

## Gulamgiri

- He sharply opposed the Brahmans' claim that they were superior because they were Aryans. Phule argued Aryans were foreigners who subjugated those who lived in the land before them. Therefore, they have no right to the land and power they now owned, and it belonged to the indigenous people that were considered "low" castes.
- Phule founded the Satyashodhak Samaj, an association which propagated caste equality.

> [!info] Phule was critical of the anti-colonial nationalism preached by the upper castes. He said that they give advice to the Shudras, Muslims, and Parsi youth to forget their caste differences and unite to go against the British and then it would be "me here and you over there". This is to say that the upper-castes would again continue their same caste distinctions against the "lower"-castes and untouchability.

## Who could enter temples?

- Struggles on caste equality movements were continued by other great leaders as well. Among them, upon his return to India in 1919, Ambedkar wrote extensively about "upper"-caste people in contemporary society.
- In 1927, he started a temple entry movement, in which his Mahar caste followers participated. He led three of these movements between 1927 and 1935 with the aim to open the eyes of the people to see the power of caste prejudices in society.

## The Non-Brahman movement

- The Non-Brahman movement started in the early twentieth century, initiated by non-Brahmans who got access to resources, mainly revolved around the argument that Brahmans were the descendants of the foreign Aryans who subjugated the indigenous Dravidians.

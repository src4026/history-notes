# East India Company Comes East

## The Company Begins Trade in Bengal


### How Trade Led to Battles

In the early eighteenth century, the conflict between the Company and the nawabs intensified. There were constant arguments of each of the parties causing problems to one other - neither could stay in harmony. And after Aurangzeb's death, the independent nawabs began to assert their dominance and kept the Company at bay, even denying many of its concessions such as the right to mint coins, right to trade, and their fortification. All these eventually reached it's zenith in the Battle of Plassey.

### The Battle of Plassey

Mir Jafar died in 1656 and the Company decided to "become Nawabs themselves". In 1765, the Mughal emperor appointed the Company as the Diwan of the provinces of Bengal. The ability to collect revenue solved their need for resources to maintain themselves. However it had no supply of gold and silver from Britain to trade with India and thus used the revenue to purchase cotton and silk textiles from India itself! And to support their troops, cost of building company forts and offices in Calcutta.

### Company Officials Became "nabobs"

After the Battle of Plassey, the original Nawabs of Bengal were pushed out and forced to give vast lands and sums of money as "personal" gifts to the Company officials. Robert Clive had come to India in 1743 at the age of 18 till the time he died in 1767, he had amassed heaps of fortune. Ironically, he was asked to remove corruption when he was appointed governor of Bengal in 1764, but he himself was cross-examined by the British Parliament and found to have had suspiciously large wealth. He committed suicide in 1774. Not all officials succeeded in making money like Clive, and many were from humble backgrounds who came to India to find good business, live their livelihood and go back to their country. These were called as "nabobs" - the anglicised version of "nawabs".

### Tipu Sultan - The "Tiger of Mysore"

The Company only resorted to direct military confrontation when it felt a threat to it's political or economic interests. Such as in the case of the Indian state of Mysore. Mysore had grown considerably under the leadership of Haidar Ali (1761-1782) and his son Tipu Sultan (1782-1799). Mysore had taken control of a profitable trade of the Malabar coast where the Company purchased pepper and cardamom. In 1785, Tipu Sultan stopped the export of sandalwood, pepper, and cardamom through the ports of his kingdom and disallowed local merchants from trading with the Company. He established a relationship with the French and modernised his army using their help. The British saw Haidar and Tipu as rulers that needed to be crushed - who were in their pathway to victory. Four battles were fought: 1767-69, 1780-84, 1790-92, and 1799. In the final battle, that is, the Battle of Seringapatam, did the Company ultimately win a victory against Tipu Sultan, who died while defending his capital. Mysore was subject to a subsidiary alliance under their former Wodeyars dynasty.

### War with the Marathas

From the late eighteenth century, the Company sought to defeat the Marathas as well - who were known for their sometimes "hostility". After the Marathas lost the Third Battle of Panipat in 1761, they could no longer hunt for ruling Delhi. They became divided into several states ruled by various dynasties like the Sindhia, Holkar, Gaikwad, and Bhonsle. These were held together by a confederacy headed my a Peshwa who became it's primary military and administrative centre at Pune. Mahajadi Sindhia and Nana Phandis were two famous Maratha soldiers and headmen. The first war that the Marathas fought with the British was with the Treaty of Salbai (1782) , but there was no clear victor. In the Second Anglo-Maratha War (1803-05), the battle took place in different fronts, resulting in the British gaining Orissa and the territories north of the Yamuna river inclduing Agra and Delhi. Finally, in the third war of 1817-19, the Company crushed the Maratha power. The Peshwa was sent to Bithu near Kanpur with a pension, overthrown by the British who now had full control over the south of the Vindhyas.

### The Claim to Paramountcy

It is clear that from the early nineteenth century, The Company pursued an aggressive policy of expansion. Governor-General Lord Hastings (1803-05) initiated a policy of "paramountcy", which stated that British authority was supreme. Therefore, in order to protect it's interests, it could annex of threaten to annex to any Indian Kingdom. This ideal continued to lead the Company's further policies as well. However, this was not left unchallenged. When the British came to annex the state of Kitoor, Rani Channama took to arms and led an anti-British movement against the invading forces. She was arrested in 1824 and died in prison in 1829. Rayanna, a poor chowkidar of Sangoli in Kitoor continued the resistance and with popular support destroyed several British camps and records. He was caught and hanged bu the British camps and records.

In the late 1830s, the Company became worried about the emerging Russia. Driven by this fear, they led conquests in the north-west. They fought with Afghanistan from 1838 to 1842 and established indirect rule. Sind was taken over in 1843. Punjab was next, but the presence of Maharaja Ranjit Singh held them back. After his death in 1839, two prolonged wars were fought with the Sikh Kingdom. Punjab was annexed in 1849.

### The Doctrine of Lapse

Under Lord Dalhousie (Governor-General from 1848) the final series of annexations took place. He devised a policy in which if there are no male heirs to an Indian ruler, their kingdom would "lapse". Meaning it would become a part of Company territory. Kingdoms such as Satara (1848), Sambalpur (1850), Udaipur (1852), Nagpur (1853), and Jhansi (1854). In 1856, the Company took over Awadh with the added argument defending their "obliged duty" to "free the people from misgovernment" of the Nawab! Seeing this, the people of Awadh revolted in large fashion in 1857.

## Setting up a New Administration

Warren Hastings (Governor-General 1773 to 1785) was an influential figure in shaping the Company's administration and a significant expansion of Company as well. British territories were majorly divided into administrative units called presidencies. There were three - Bengal, Bombay, and Madras. Each was ruled by the Governor, but the supreme head of the administration was the Governor-General. Hastings was the first and introduced several reforms, notably in the judiciary.
As the Collector of a district gained more power, it steadily became the hub of patronage and authority, replacing its predecessors.

## Conclusion

Therefore, the East India Company was transformed from a trading Company to a territorial colonial power. Development in steam engine technology also made the process faster, reducing travel time by a large factor. By 1857, the Company to exercise direct rule over about 63% of the territory of India and 78% of the Indian population. Virtually, in complete control when taking into account it's indirect influence.

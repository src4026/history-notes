# The Company Becomes the Diwan

On 12 August 1965, the Mughal emperor appointed the East India Company as the Diwan of Bengal. For the Company, and Robert Clive, this was a memorable moment in the British thought. Diwani allowed the Company to be the chief administrator and in-charge of land and revenue collection. The Company used this to its advantage and fulfilling its expenses.

In this chapter, we shall see the various methods through which the Company acquired revenue, pacified the local rulers, change the social structure, and produce crops of its interest.

## Revenue for the Company

Despite being the Diwan, the Company still saw itself as a trader. It wanted a large revenue income but was unwilling to make complete assessments and carry out necessary calculations - as they mainly bothered for their own profit with as little effort from themselves. Before 1856, the Company traded silver and gold for textiles in India such as cotton and silk. Now the Company employed the revenue flow from Bengal to buy these goods! Bengal soon plunged into a major crisis . With artisans deserting villages due to low pay and the peasants became unable to pay their rents. The economy (especially agriculture) hinted to a decline and collapse. A terrible famine in 1770 killed ten million people, a third of the population.

## All Was not well

Despite the optimistic views of the official that the systems they introduced, peasants could not be transformed into rich enterprising. Revenue rates were fixed too high, peasants, ryots, and the working class fled and were unable to pay the amounts the compounded on them.

# Crops for Europe

The Company also realised that the countryside could also be used to generate crops that Europe required. By the late eighteenth century, the Company worked hard to expand its cultivation of opium and indigo. In the century and a half that followed, the British persuaded or forced cultivators in various parts of India to produce other crops: jute in Bengal, tea in Assam, sugarcane in the United Provinces (now in Uttar Pradesh), wheat in Punjab, cotton in Maharashtra and Punjab, rice in Madras.

In the following paragraphs, we shall see some of the methods used by the British to do so.

## Why the Demand for Indian Indigo?

The indigo plant primarily grows in the tropics. By the thirteenth century, Indian indigo was being used by cloth manufacturers in Italy, France, and Britain to dye cloth. The amount of indigo that reached the European markets was little in expensive. Therefore, cloth manufacturers in Europe had to reply on woad - a plant that produced a pale and dull violet-blue. It was a plant of a temperate zone, and thus found in more numbers in Europe. It was grown in northern Italy, southern France, and in parts of Germany and Britain. The producers of woad soon became worried about competition with indigo. So, they pressured their governments to ban the import of indigo.
By the end of the eighteenth century, the demand for Indian indigo increased, and as Britain began to industrialise, its cotton production expanded dramatically, creating enormous new demand for cloth dyes. While the demand for indigo increased, its supplies from West Indies and America collapsed. Between 1783 and 1789, the production of indigo was cut by half. Cloth dyers in Britain were desperately looking for other sources of Indigo. But from where?

## Britain Turns to India

The Company now looked for ways to expand its area under indigo cultivation in India. From the last decades of the eighteenth century, indigo cultivation in Bengal expanded rapidly and Bengal indigo came to dominate the world market. In 1788, only about 30% of the indigo imported into Britain was from India. By 1810, the proportion had to up to 95%.
With this increase in indigo trade, commercial agents began investing in indigo production, and many Company officials left their jobs to work on their indigo business. Attracted by the prospect of high profit, Scotsmen and Englishmen came to India and became planters. Those who had no money to produce indigo could get loans from the Company and banks.

## The "Blue Rebellion" and After

The revolt led to the collapse of indigo production in Bengal. But the planters now shifted towards Bihar. Despite the impact of the discovery of synthetic fibres on their business they continued to expand. When Mahatma Gandhi returned from South Africa, a peasant from Bihar requested him to visit Champaran and see the plight of the indigo cultivators there. Mahatma Gandhi's visit in 1917 marked the beginning of the Champaran movement against the indigo planters.

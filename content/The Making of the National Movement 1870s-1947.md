# The Emergence of Nationalism

Following the various developments taking place in India, its people and various political associations formed after 1850 (especially those that came into being in the 1870s and 1880s, mostly led by English-educated professionals such as lawyers), started raising the question for whom India belonged to.

> [!example] *Poona Sarvajanik Sabha*, the Bombay Presidency Association, the *Madras Mahajan Sabha*, the Indian Association, and the Indian National Congress were the more notable ones.

The goals of these associations was not one of a particular region, community, or class, but with the idea that all people should be sovereign[^sovereign].


- The **Arms Act** was passed in 1878, disallowing Indians from possessing arms.
- In the same year, the Vernacular Act allowed the British government to confiscate any assets of the newspapers including their printing presses if anything published was found "objectionable".
- In 1883, the government tried to introduce the Ilbert Bill, which provided for the trial of British or European people by Indians, and sought quality between British and Indian judges in the country. But due to forceful white opposition, the bill was withdrawn.
- With the ever growing need of an all-India organisation of educated Indians since the 1880s, the Indian National Congress was established when 72 delegates from around the country met in Bombay in December 1885.
- Most of the early leaders, such as, **Dadabhai Naoroji**, **Pherozeshah Mehta**, **Badruddin Tyabji**, **WC Bonnerji**, **Surendranath Banerji**, **Romesh Chandra Dutt**, and **S Subramania Iyer**, were largely  from Bombay and Calcutta.
- Naoroji, a businessman and publicist[^publicist] settled in London, and for a time, a member of of the British Parliament, guided young nationalists.
- A retired British official, **A O Hume** also played a part in uniting Indians from various regions.

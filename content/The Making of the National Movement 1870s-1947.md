# The Emergence of Nationalism

Following the various developments taking place in India, its people and various political associations formed after 1850 (especially those that came into being in the 1870s and 1880s, mostly led by English-educated professionals such as lawyers), started raising the question for whom India belonged to.

> [!example] *Poona Sarvajanik Sabha*, the Bombay Presidency Association, the *Madras Mahajan Sabha*, the Indian Association, and the Indian National Congress were the more notable ones.

The goals of these associations was not one of a particular region, community, or class, but with the idea that all people should be sovereign[^sovereign].


> [!info] New laws and policies
> - The **Arms Act** was passed in 1878, disallowing Indians from possessing arms.
> - In the same year, the Vernacular Act allowed the British government to confiscate any assets of the newspapers including their printing presses if anything published was found "objectionable".
> - In 1883, the government tried to introduce the Ilbert Bill, which provided for the trial of British or European people by Indians, and sought quality between British and Indian judges in the country. But due to forceful white opposition, the bill was withdrawn.

- With the ever growing need of an all-India organisation of educated Indians since the 1880s, the Indian National Congress was established when 72 delegates from around the country met in Bombay in December 1885.
- Most of the early leaders, such as, **Dadabhai Naoroji**, **Pherozeshah Mehta**, **Badruddin Tyabji**, **WC Bonnerji**, **Surendranath Banerji**, **Romesh Chandra Dutt**, and **S Subramania Iyer**, were largely  from Bombay and Calcutta.
- A retired British official, **A O Hume** also played a part in uniting Indians from various regions.

> [!tldr] Dadabhai Naoroji
> - He was businessman and publicist[^publicist] who settled in London and was a key figure in guiding young nationalists.
> - For a time, he was a member of of the British Parliament.
> - His book *Poverty and Un-British Rule in India* sharply criticsed the British and elucidating how the British rule ruined the economy of India.

## A nation in the making

- The Congress in its early twenties was often called as "moderate", due to their moderate methods and aims. They worked to spread awareness among Indians and asked for provision of higher positions for them.
- The Congress made several demands other than these, like the separation of the judiciary from the executive and the repeal[^repeal] of the Arms Act and the Vernacular Press Act.
- Among all the work the Moderate leaders did to develop awareness through newspapers, articles, speeches, and so on, they felt that they had to make the government aware of the feelings of Indians. This arose from their belief that the British respected the ideals of freedom and justice.

## "Freedom is our birthright"

- Entering the 1890s, multiple Indians begin questioning the method of the Congress - their "politics of prayers". 
- Leaders such as Bepin Chandra Pal (Bengal), Bal Gangadhar Tilak (Maharashtra), and Lala Lajpat Rai (Punjab) started exploring more "radical" objectives and stressed the importance of self-reliance and constructive work.
- The Marathi newspaper *Kesari*, edited by Bal Gangadhar Tilak, became one of the strongest critics of the British rule.

> [!summary] Swadeshi Movement
> - Bengal was once the largest province in India, consisting parts of Bihar and Orrissa. In 1905, Viceroy Curzon partitioned Bengal, citing "administrative convenience". Of course, the convenience was from the point of view of the British.
> - The Congress, Moderates and Radicals alike, opposed it.
> - Instead of separating non-Bengali areas from the province, it merged the Eastern part of the now divided Bengal with Assam - likely to curtail the Begali politicians and split the Bengali people.
> - This infuriated people all over India and the struggle that resulted was called the *Swadeshi movement*.
> - Although it was greatest in Bengal, its effect reached other places as well. For instance, it was known as the *Vandemataram Movement* in deltaic Andhra.

- In 1906, a group of Muslim landlords and nawabs formed the All India Muslim Leage at Dacca. Unlike others, the Muslim League supported the partition of Bengal.
- The League demanded separate electorates for Muslims, resulting in reservation of seats in the council[^council] for Muslims. These could be elected by Muslim votes. This decision tempted various politicians to obtain support by distributing favours to their own religious groups.
- Meanwhile, the Congress split in 1907. The Moderates refused to agree with the boycott and "revolutionary violence"[^rv] visioned by the Radicals. Then, the Congress was dominated by Moderators with outside influence from Tilak's followers. However, the factions united in December 1915.
- The next year (1916), the Congress and the Muslim League signed the Lucknow Pact to collaborate for representing the government in the country.

# The Growth of Mass Nationalism

- From the year 1919, the struggle against British rule spread all over with numerous people participating from different sections of society - a mass movement.
- Due to the First World War, the government imposed higher taxes to compensate for the increase in war supplies. This allowed Indian industries and business groups to expand and gain profit. These business groups demanded more opportunities for development. In this, they began supporting the Congress as well.
- A large number of villagers were pressured to join the army for an "alien cause". When the soldiers returned, they had experienced the affect of imperialism and tensions arose.
- Adding to this, in 1917, a Russian revolution took place. Ideals of socialism and workers' struggles inspired Indian nationalists.

## The advent of Mahatma Gandhi

> [!important] In 1895, along with other Indians, Mahatma Gandhi established the Natal Congress to fight against racial discrimination.

- In 1915, Gandhiji returned to India. At first, he decided to travel throughout the country to analyse the situation of the people.
- His earliest works were in the local movements in Champaran, Kheda, and Ahmedabad where he met Rajendra Prasad and Vallabhbhai Patel.
- In Ahmedabad, he led a successful millworkers' strike in 1918.

## The Rowlatt Satyagraha

> [!info] The Rowlatt Act curbed fundamental rights such as the freedom of expression and strengthened police powers.

- In 1919, Gandhiji gave a call for a *satyagrapaha* against the Rowlatt Act that the British had passed. He asked the Indians to observer 6 April 1919 as a day of non-violent opposition, "humiliation and prayer" and *hartal* (strike).
- The government attempted violent methods to suppress these strikes. The Jallianwala Bagh Massacre ordered by General Dyer in Amritsar on Baisakhi day were among them. 
- In pain and anger, Rabindranath Tagore revoked his knighthood[^knighthood].

> [!summary] During the Rowlatt Satyagraha, the people actively tried to ensure that Hindus and Muslims were united to oppose the British. Gandhiji always saw India as the land for *all* of the people who lived in the country.

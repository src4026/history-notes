# About the project

Hello, I am Sasha. This website is my vault of the notes I created for my History classes. As you can see, the organisation and style of my note-taking are constantly changing - so it can get messy! 

I've made these notes public so that my fellow schoolmates or any random stranger on the internet find them helpful.

# Structure of the vault

> [!info] See [[#Course books]] for the list of chapters I've made notes for of a textbook.

- All my notes for different chapters lie in the root of the vault itself; no folders. 
- There are notes for chapters and a note for an entire textbook, which contains links to the chapters of that textbook. The tags #chapter and #textbook are used for these.
- Tags like #ðŸŒ± , #ðŸŒ² , and #ðŸŒž are used to show the status of a note.
	- #ðŸŒ± refers to "seedling" notes. (WIP).
	- #ðŸŒ² refers to evergreen notes. (Completed).
	- #ðŸŒž refers to notes that need a few changes and polishing touches before becoming an #ðŸŒ² note.

## Course books
1. [[Our Pasts - III]] (Class 8)

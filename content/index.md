title: Welcome to My History Notes Vault

# About the project

Hello, I am Sasha. This website is my vault of the notes I created for my History classes. As you can see, the organisation and style of my note-taking are constantly changing - so it can get messy! 

I've made these notes public so that my fellow schoolmates or any random stranger on the internet find them helpful.

# Structure

All my notes for different chapters lie in the root of the vault itself (so basically, no folders). The only structure of the vault is that I have a note linking all the chapters of a particular textbook. Here is a list of them:
1. [[Our Pasts - III]]

# Contributing

If you have found an error, want to improve my notes or have suggestions, you can do by
- Creating an issue or PR as applicable on [GitHub](https://github.com/src4026/history/notes).
- Contacting me through my email ID (`src4026@proton.me`), by other communication methods, or in-person.

Any form of help is highly appreciated.

title: Welcome to My History Notes Vault

Hello, I am Sasha. This website is my vault of the notes I created for my Hishistory classes. As you can see, the organisation and style of my note-taking are constantly changing - so it can get messy!
I've made these notes public so that my fellow schoolmates or any random stranger on the internet find them helpful. Cheers ;)
